# Wealth In Hand Debt Analyzer

## Overview
The US national debt recently crossed the $22 trillion threshold. While debt isn't inherently a bad thing, American consumers' lack of  understanding for how to manage it can be debilitating.

Wealth In Hand is a financial wellness provider that brings education to employees and individuals. This tool for Wealth In Hand helps users understand the cost of carrying debt, how much they will pay in interest before they are debt-free.
