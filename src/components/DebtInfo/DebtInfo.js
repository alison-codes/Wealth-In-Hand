            <h1> Let's talk about debt.</h1>
            <p>When you’re worried about money and feel your options are limited, debt can feel like a pair of handcuffs.
                And if it feels like you can’t do what you want to do—which is to pay it all off and get yourself free—there’s the temptation to do nothing.
                You can escape debt, of course, but unless you expect to win the lottery or inherit a large sum of money, it helps to have a solid plan for how you’ll do it.
            </p>
            <p>At Wealth In Hand, we strive to teach you about different approaches to debt elimination—and which solutions work best for your situation.

            <h4>Looking in the Mirror</h4>
            <p>The first step to managing your debt effectively is to know where you stand. We hope this tool, alongside our debt tips and tricks, we help you understand the effect of your debt.
            </p>
            <p>You might an idea of what your debt interest rate is, but by the time you’ve made payments, you may be shocked to see how much those interest payments have added onto your bill.
                </p>
            <h4>Prioritizing Your Expenses</h4>
            <p>Make sure you’re current on your car loan and car insurance, especially if that’s your only way to get to work. Next, do your best with other big debts, such as student loans or large loans from friends and family. You want to take care of these, but you may be able to get some relief or student loan forgiveness if you stay in contact with the lender and ask for help. You also may want to consider consolidating and refinancing your student loans into one manageable payment.</p>
